# Vize's Coding Style

The coding style we use is almost identical to Meteor's recommended style and
Prettier's default style. The only differences are:

*   We use a larger indention size of 4 characters so that the code's structure
    is easier to see.
*   We put trailing commas in multi-line object and array literals. This is done
    so that new fields/elements can be appended without changing the line above
    them.
*   We use prose wrapping to make Markdown documents more readable when
    displayed as plain text.

It should be noted that these changes are not applied to JSON files. The files
`package.json` and `package-lock.json` are edited by NPM and it would be a
unneeded hassle to fight with it on formating.

## Tools

To help enforce the coding style we are using Prettier. Prettier corrects any
formatting errors automatically.

To help detect errors and low quality code we are going to use ESLint, but this
has not yet been setup yet.

## Setup on Atom

### Editor Settings

For configuring Atom's editor settings you should use the EditorConfig package.
EditorConfig reads settings from the `.editorconfig` file and overrides Atom's
normal settings. This makes it so that you can use the proper settings in this
project, and still use your preferred settings in your other projects all
without ever changing your settings.

1.  Install the `editorconfig` package into Atom.
1.  Do not change any of this package's settings.

### Prettier

1.  Install the `prettier-atom` package into Atom.
1.  Select the option "Format Files on Save". This will make Prettier run
    automatically whenever you save a file so that you never accidentally commit
    bad code into Git.
1.  Select the options "Only format if Prettier is found in your project's
    dependencies" and "Only format if a Prettier config is found". These options
    will prevent Prettier from running on any other projects that you may work
    on.
1.  Do not change any of the other settings for this package.
