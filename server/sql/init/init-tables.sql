-- In case anyone was wondering, here are some features that PostgreSQL
-- has that MariaDB and other MySQL-ites don't:
-- -> Deferrable constraints
-- -> Check constraints
-- -> DDL and DML statements that never commit transactions without asking permission
-- TODO:
-- - Add users.js to your list of JS files to "translate" to postgres
--		-> user-related SQL fields will reference it
--		-> will be nice if it can be used alongside current user accounts
--			before they are replaced by GraphQL
-- WARNING --
-- Let the reader beware:
-- camelCase is used in this file for readability, but
-- *NOTE* while  SQL dialects are weakly typed,
-- the table, field, trigger, constraint, and function
-- names are converted entirely to lowercase. *NOTE*
-- This actually can cause strange null pointer
-- exceptions when working with plv8 code.
-- If in doubt, use all lowercase or snakecase
-- when writing queries or stored function code.

-- NOTE We're not actually managing user accounts in PostgreSQL
-- at this stage, but this table might be handy when we do.
-- In any case, right now it helps us handle Mongo/Postgres
-- compatibility by allowing us to translate user ID's from
-- one DBMS to the other.
-- NOTE Here are some features of the current SimplSchema for
-- Meteor.users (imports/api/data/users.js) that I'm
-- not going to worry about for now:
-- -> keeping track of the emails array, since this requires
--		normalization and thus an additional table
-- -> username, because it isn't really used
-- -> services, because it isn't really used and there
--		are no real specifications for it
-- QUESTION So, now that we're here, how to actually do
-- the submittedBy fields for the other documents?
-- I think that reviews and salaries should have it as
-- an optional foreign key field, so that it can be NULL
-- instead of having to be adjusted to a unique value
-- when not provided, which would mean having to initialize
-- the users table a particular way in order to accommodate
-- truly anonymous submissions.
-- This is a moot point for jobads, which already have
-- companyId as a required foreign key.
-- That leaves comments and votes.
-- Comments can probably be handled in the same way as
-- reviews and salaries, for the same reason.
-- Votes is trickier because submittedBy is part of the
-- primary key, which doesn't readily accommodate anonymous
-- voting (only one person could cast a vote with submittedBy = NULL,
-- and then the constraint would prevent further such
-- NULL votes). But I guess if we wanted votes to be anonymous
-- then we could implement privacy guards higher up the
-- stack, and it makes sense to require users to have
-- accounts before voting.
-- So, for the PostgreSQL migration, we have the following
-- changes to the submittedBy field in the various tables:
-- reviews: optional foreign key to users
-- salaries: optional foreign key to users
-- jobads: N/A
-- companies: N/A
-- review_comments: optional foreign key to users
-- review/comment_votes: required foreign key to users
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users CASCADE;

-- Dummy user to (temporarily?) allow the submitting
-- of reviews, salaries, votes, and comments but users
-- who do not have an account yet...such as the kind
-- folk who submitted the first reviews on the site.
-- BUG? Hopefully won't run into issues with there not being
-- an associated Mongo account (this is untested)...
INSERT INTO users (userid,role) VALUES (-1,'worker');

-- NOTE submittedBy fields are numeric in this implementation,
-- but could be displayed on the website as "user[submittedBy]"
-- in place of a screen name

-- NOTE So, reviews and salaries have some interesting requirements.
-- On the one hand we need to be able to aggregate review and salary
-- data about an individual company, and logically each review and salary
-- must have a corresponding company. However, they want users to be able
-- to submit reviews and salaries for companies that don't have profiles,
-- so it's not as simple as just using foreign keys. Here's what
-- I've come up with:
-- companyName is required in all cases, but in the "exception" case,
-- there will be no companyId. So logically it would seem like
-- this translates to companyName being a required field,
-- with companyId as an optional foreign key field. If the case is
-- not the exception case, then we would expect the caller
-- to provide the companyid.
-- Then the only caveat is users leaving reviews for companies
-- in the non-exception case where the name given does not match
-- the recorded name of the company with that id. This can be handled
-- either in a trigger or by the caller.
-- This may make it necessary to allow the companyName field to be
-- updated for correction in case of typos, or to be automatically
-- updated when a companyid is supplied.
-- -> NOTE could probably just assume that id trumps name
-- and autocorrect in a before-insert trigger
-- Of course, this will not be enough to catch all mistakes made
-- in the exception case, but at that point I'm afraid we'll have
-- to rely on good UI or "manual correction".
-- Although, logically it seems to makes sense that reviews for
-- companies with different names would be treated as reviews for
-- different companies: that's just taking the user at their word,
-- and in that light it makes perfect sense to offload the burden of
-- mistake-checking to either them or the front-end.
