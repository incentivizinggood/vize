-- In case anyone was wondering, here are some features that PostgreSQL
-- has that MariaDB and other MySQL-ites don't:
-- -> Deferrable constraints
-- -> Check constraints
-- -> DDL and DML statements that never commit transactions without asking permission
-- TODO:
-- - Add users.js to your list of JS files to "translate" to postgres
--		-> user-related SQL fields will reference it
--		-> will be nice if it can be used alongside current user accounts
--			before they are replaced by GraphQL

	-- the desired exception cases (where someone can leave a review
	-- for a company that has no profile yet)? Two options:
	-- 0) Wait, is this even a problem since the fields aren't declared NOT NULL?
	--		Logically the only separation between cases is session flow, so
	--		it might make sense to leave these fields as optional since the
	--		database doesn't care about session flow.
	-- -> FALSE, companyName is NOT NULL, that was a mistake earlier.
	-- 1) TRIGGER to check for a profile, if it doesn't exist then
	--		create a dummy one, perhaps with a special flag
	-- -> This is going to be fugly.
	-- 2) DISABLE TRIGGERS, perform the desired insertion, then reenable
	--		triggers. Not sure if this is viable, it will only work if
	--		ALTER TABLE doesn't auto-commit the transaction, and only if
	--		we can make sure that the transaction has an Xlock on this table.
