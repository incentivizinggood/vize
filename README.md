Vize is a platform for accountability and a catalyst for progress.

Workers are able to share reviews of their working conditions with other
workers. This gives workers the information they need to avoid factories with
terrible working conditions. Factories with poor reputations will have trouble
getting workers, and thus are unable to fulfill orders, do business, and make
profits. This creates a direct and strong incentive for factories to improve
conditions.

Feedback coming directly from the workforce helps everyone, including the
factories. Factory managers are given access premium quality information that
would normally require expensive surveying and be abridged by fear. Bad
factories get better and good factories get awesome. By working together and
having an honest discussion everyone wins.
