			"Going back to school and getting a degree can be an enormous opportunity to increase your skill set as well as your wages, but many people don’t have the time or the money to finish an entire program. A degree can take years to complete and cost thousands of dollars. If you are working full time this can seem nearly impossible. There is another option, short-term training programs. These courses can give you a experience in accounting, management, writing, or much more. They generally only last about 1 month and are a fraction of the cost of a full degree. If you are interested in finding a course that fits your job and gives you the opportunity to increase your wages, you can find UABC’s programs ",

You may have to work 5 - 6 days a week with long hours, so going to a normal class during the week is impossible. The key is to find an education that allows you to be flexible with your schedule, and doesn’t require going to class every day. This is why the Tecnologico Nacional de Mexico created the Educacion a Distancia, a course designed for people that work full-time but want to increase their skills to find a new and better paying job. The courses are taught only on Saturdays for 4 - 6 hours and the rest of the class can be done entirely online with your phone or a computer. Right now there are two majors provided, Industrial Engineering and Logistics Engineering. If you’re interested you can check out their website ",

			"Figuring out what your employees actually think and want from your company can be very difficult. Often times they are afraid of upsetting their managers because they don’t want to lose their jobs or be punished.  Instead many employees would rather just leave for a different company. So how do you learn what your employees really want to ensure they stay and don’t become another turnover statistic? We at Vize want to help. We’ve created a platform for employees to tell you what is great and what could be improved in your factory. You can read their ratings on various aspects of your company like wages, benefits, manager relationship, and health and safety. With this general knowledge you can then read their reviews to get a more in-depth understanding of your employees. If you contact the Vize team we can also help analyze those reviews and give you direct feedback on your employees deepest concerns and how to use these insights to lower the turnover rate. If you’d be interested in contacting the Vize team please email us at ",
